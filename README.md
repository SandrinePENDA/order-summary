## My process

Step-1: setting up the project environment (tree structure, Sass preprocessor, resolving script blocking bug on Windows 10, etc.). 

Step-2: I drew and cut out the model on a piece of paper, mentioning the semantic tag for each block. This made it easy to write down the structure of the web page.

Step-3: save on Github (commit and push) what has been done until here, including the index.html file with its basic code.

Step-4: let's coding ... :)

### Built with

- No Figma/Sketch files
- Semantic HTML5 markup (accessibility)
- CSS3: 
  - BEM class names 
  - Custom properties 
  - Flexbox
  - Media queries for responsive content
- Sass preprocessor
  - Variable for font
  - Variables for colors


### What I learned

I set myself the challenge of integrating this page as faithfully as possible, **without Figma/Sketch files**, based only on the final rendering (image) and simply using my observation. Of course, my rendering will not be pixel-perfect but as we say: who can do more can do less.

Use the Sass preprocessor is very interesting ; I particulary like the way CSS is easily nested. 

### Continued development

For future projects, I'm going to continue my in-depth exploration of the Sass preprocessor.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - It is helpful for finding the right syntax of CSS properties and their values, or simply how they run.
- [Sass Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/) - For understanding how to install and use it.
- [To validate my HTML5 code](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - I've used it to ensure that my code complies with W3C standards, and to correct where necessary.
- [To validate my CSS code](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - This is the equivalent for the CSS3. Using these both validators is a good coding practice.
